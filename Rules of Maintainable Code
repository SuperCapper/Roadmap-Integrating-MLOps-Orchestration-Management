### Clarity and Readability

### 1. Don’t Write Clean Code, Write Predictable Code.
Rule: Structure your code so its behavior is always clear and easy to guess.
Description: Avoid clever shortcuts, complex math tricks, or hidden side effects. If a function is named calculate_total, it shouldn't also update the user's database entry. Predictable code is safe code.
