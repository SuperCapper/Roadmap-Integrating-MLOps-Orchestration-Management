Project estimation isn’t about being the fastest. It’s about being the most reliable.

  The first question you get before taking up any new project is:

  “How soon can you build this for me?”

  The question is tougher than it seems.

You can’t commit to a tight timeline, because you might end up working weekends. Also, there will be a risk of delaying the project. You can’t say it’ll take too long either, because customers usually want their app live yesterday.

Every estimate has two paths:

  Shortcut: commit early, sound optimistic, and regret later.
  
  Smart: Break down the scope. Cover the dependencies. Include testing. Don’t forget non-functional needs. And always add    contingency.

***************************************************************

In this article, I’ll share common mistakes in project estimation and how I deal with them.

Let’s start with the very first step. The one that is actually more important than estimating itself.

Defining the Scope
  In my early days, I used to quote a timeline purely on my gut feeling. For example, I would look at a new project and      say, “It will be done in three months.”
  
  Why? Because I had done something similar, and it had taken me three months.
  
  Relying on this method repeatedly backfired on me.
  
  You can’t simply commit to a timeline based only on your past experiences.
  
  You need to know the scope well, even before attempting to estimate.
  
  A client asks, “Can you build me an e-commerce app that delivers health supplements to gym-goers. How soon can you make    this app for me?”
  
  The correct approach is to dig deeper:
  
    * “Do you need a cart, payment gateway, or delivery tracking?”
    * “What kind of users will the system support? customers, admins, delivery partners?”
  
  That’s the only way you will arrive at a realistic estimate.
  
  It’s tempting to commit to a timeline that the customer wants to hear and get the project done.
  
  But if you don’t know the features, payments, delivery modes, or users, you’ll run into trouble.
  
  Things to Remember While Estimating
  You can’t simply estimate a project by glancing at the requirements. A good estimate covers not only coding time but       also the work needed to make the project ready for launch.

*******************************************************************

Common Mistakes Developers Make While Estimating

1. Ignoring Dependencies

  A client asks:
  
    “I need a booking app for my fitness studio. It should allow users to book slots. I also want them to get reminders.”
  
    A quick response might be: “I’ve done something similar before; it should take 6 weeks.”
  
  But what gets missed? Integration with payment gateways. SMS/email services. Calendar syncs.
  
  These are all external dependencies that can significantly delay your timelines.
  
  Clarify the dependencies:
  
    * Which payment gateways?
    * What kind of reminders (SMS, push, email)?
    * Should bookings sync with external calendars?
  
  Suddenly, the real timeline may stretch from 6 weeks to 10–12 weeks, and you’ll actually deliver on time.

2. Underestimating QA & Testing

  Many developers calculate only coding time. For example: “I can very comfortably build this food delivery app in 8         weeks.”
  
  What they forget:
  
    * Unit testing cycles.
    * QA testing across devices and edge cases.
    * Retesting after bug fixes.
  
  To fix this, use a split like this:
  
    * Coding: 40%
    * QA & Testing: 40%
    * Everything else (requirements, docs, rework, etc.): 20%
  
  When you tell a client “12 weeks”, it reflects not just code but a production-ready system.

3. Forgetting Non-Functional Requirements

  A client says:
  
    “I want an app where 10,000 users can log in daily to check their portfolio.
  
  Most developers estimate based on features only: login, dashboard, and reports. They skip performance, security, and       cloud costs.
  
  Always ask:
  
    * Expected peak load?
    * Compliance requirements (GDPR & HIPAA)?
    * How do you want to take care of disaster recovery and failover?
  
  These efforts often double the work but save the project from failure in production.

4. Not Adding Contingency

  The Mistake:
  A developer promises, “We’ll launch it in 14 weeks.”
  
  Halfway through, the client requests chat, stories, or notifications. Suddenly, 14 weeks become 20.
  
  As a rule of thumb, always add a 10–15% buffer.
  
  One could say, “This looks like 14 weeks, but let’s keep 16 in case of changes.”
  
  If you know that the client will be hesitant, then you can quote 16 weeks by adding a buffer yourself.
  
  I personally keep it transparent; it builds trust.

5. Rushing Through Design

  The Mistake:
  You promise a client, “We’ll figure out the design as we build. Let’s not delay development.”
  
  After three sprints, the client says in the demo, “This is not what I wanted.”
  
  Now you’re not just building features — you’re redesigning old ones while trying to move forward. Morale drops,            deadlines slip.
  
  The Correct Way:
  Even though design only looks like a small slice (~3%), it has a huge multiplier effect. A good UI/UX flow ensures:
  
  * Developers know exactly what to build.
  * Clients align early on the look and feel.
  * Scalability for future features is easier.
  
  If you have to spend even a week on mockups, do it. This will save weeks of redoing going forward.

6. Not Accounting for Processes

  The Mistake:
  You calculate pure coding + testing time and commit to a 12-week delivery.
  
  But you didn’t consider time spent on:
  
  * Code reviews.
  * Sprint planning & retrospectives.
  * Daily standups.
  * Communication with stakeholders.
  
  The process eats up your development time.
  
  The Correct Way:
  Always factor in 2–3% for processes.
  
  They may not produce direct output, but they ensure quality, alignment, and transparency.
  
  A project with zero process discipline almost always slips in schedule.

7. Underestimating Rework

  The Mistake:
  You assume everything will be correct in the first build. But then:
  
  * The client sees the demo and changes their mind.
  * A hidden bug surfaces during staging.
  * An integration doesn’t behave as expected.
  
  If you didn’t budget for rework, your timeline collapses.
  
  The Correct Way:
  Expect rework. Budget 3–5% for it in every estimate. Be upfront with clients:
  
    “We’ve included a small buffer for iteration and change requests during demos.”
  
  This way, you are always ready, even when changes come. You look like a professional who planned for reality, not          fantasy.

8. Team-Based Estimation: When You’re Not Working Alone

  Most projects involve teams, not solo developers. Team estimation introduces new complexities that individual estimation   doesn’t cover.
  
  The Challenge of Multiple Perspectives
  You’re leading a team of 4 developers to build a fintech dashboard. Each developer estimates the user authentication       module differently:
  
    * Junior dev: “2 weeks”
    * Mid-level dev: “4 weeks”
    * Senior dev: “6 weeks”
    * You: “3 weeks”
  
  Who’s right?
  
  The Team Estimation Approach:
  
  A. Use Planning Poker
  
    * Everyone estimates simultaneously using story points or time
    * Discuss the highest and lowest estimates
    * Re-estimate until you reach consensus
    * This prevents anchoring bias, where the first estimate influences others
  
  B. Break Down by Skill Level For the authentication module:
  
    * Junior handles basic login/logout: 1.5 weeks
    * Mid-level builds OAuth integration: 2 weeks
    * Senior designs security architecture: 1 week
    * Total: 4.5 weeks (not 2, not 6)
  
  C. Account for Communication Overhead. With each additional team member, add:
  
    * Daily sync meetings: 5% overhead
    * Code reviews and pair programming: 10% overhead
    * Knowledge transfer and onboarding: 8% overhead
  
  A 4 developer team is not four times faster than an individual. It’s at best 3x faster due to coordination delay.

9. Handling Complex, Uncertain Projects

  The Three-Point Estimation Technique: For uncertain features, estimate three scenarios:
  
    * Optimistic: Everything goes perfectly (20% chance)
    * Most Likely: Normal development with typical issues (60% chance)
    * Pessimistic: Multiple complications arise (20% chance)
  
  Example: AI-powered recommendation engine
  
    * Optimistic: 4 weeks (if we find a perfect third-party API)
    * Most Likely: 8 weeks (build a custom solution with some research)
    * Pessimistic: 14 weeks (need extensive ML training and optimization)
  
  Weighted Average: (4 + 4×8 + 14) ÷ 6 = 8.3 weeks
  
    This gives you a more realistic estimate than a gut feeling.
  
  The Spike Approach: For highly uncertain features:
  
    * Budget 1–2 weeks for a “spike” (research/prototype)
    * After the spike, provide a refined estimate
    * Client gets realistic expectations without massive up-front uncertainty
  
  Example: “The AI recommendation feature needs a 1-week technical spike to evaluate feasibility. After that, I’ll provide   a concrete timeline.”
